## Overview
We would like you to build a simple single page application using the [Agify API](https://agify.io/). The user should be able to input and submit any first name. The application should then display a card with the predicted age related to that name, as well as, the sample size ("count" as it's referred to in the API). The user should also be able to delete any card by clicking on the 'x' in the upper right corner of the card. (Please refer to the mockup and let us know if you have any questions.)
​
## Requirements
- Please only use HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
- Attempt to match the mockup as closely as possible. (Colors are listed below, but we're not worried about perfect font size, just get close.)
- A maximum of 9 cards should be shown at any given time. The earliest created card is removed as count goes above 9.
- Upon refresh the cards should be persisted – any browser storage is fine for this.
​
## Colors
- Background Gray (input background and separator): #FAFAFA
- Light Gray (Sample size and placeholder): #969696
- Dark Gray (main body color): #3C3C3C
- Blue (search button and delete 'x'): #03A6C5
